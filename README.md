# Vulnerability Tracker Project

## Abstract 
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Internet Protocol (IP) data, focusing on detecting and mitigating security threats within a network. The project leverages advanced algorithms to identify and classify IP traffic anomalies, with the aim of enhancing network security. By analyzing sample IP data and employing a reference algorithm, the project highlights vulnerabilities, mitigates risks, and improves overall network efficiency.

## Introduction
In our hyper-connected world, the dependence on the Internet has grown exponentially with innovations like e-commerce and fast communication. Each day, vast amounts of data traverse the globe. With this massive flow of personal and public data, there is an increasing need to safeguard data and networks from various cyber threats.

The growing dependence on the Internet and technological innovations have led to the necessity of securing data and networks. This project aims to analyze IP traffic using advanced algorithms to detect potential security breaches. By combining real-time data analysis with automated threat response capabilities, the system provides dependable protection against cyber attacks. The project focuses on delivering reliable information about IP while enabling scalability for large-scale networks, ultimately providing comprehensive cybersecurity solutions.

## Project Architecture
The Vulnerability Tracker project architecture is designed to deliver comprehensive insights into website security and performance by integrating multiple scanning tools and APIs. The system adopts a modular approach to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of integration with various external services.

### 1. System Overview
The system architecture comprises several key components:

- **Frontend (ReactJS):** The user interface is built using React, providing an interactive dashboard where users can view detailed security reports.
- **Backend (Node.js):** The backend service is developed using Node.js and handles data processing, aggregation of scan results, and API communication.
- **Database (MongoDB):** A NoSQL database is used to store scan results, historical data, and system configurations.
- **External APIs:** The system integrates with third-party APIs for security scanning, vulnerability analysis, and data enrichment.

### 2. Scanner Components
The system integrates various scanning tools and APIs to detect potential vulnerabilities. These components are configured to run automated scans at regular intervals.

- **Web Vulnerability Scanners:** Perform regular scans of the target websites, identifying weaknesses like SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, and configuration issues.  
- **API Scanners:** These scan APIs for potential vulnerabilities such as improper authentication, authorization flaws, and data exposure.
- **Port Scanners:** Conduct scans of open ports on the target network, identifying potential entry points for attackers.

## Area of Application
